# Meshless Python Module

A small, inefficient python module for computing effective surfaces
the Hopkins 2015 way or the Ivanova 2013 way.

It's meant to test things out, generate some plots etc, 
not to be used for serious computations.

Also includes simple reading-in functions for SWIFT hdf5 output.
